This course provides a broad survey of topics at the interface of
theoretical computer science and economics. There are two overarching
course goals: 
1) Understand how to design systems with strategic
participants that have good performance guarantees. For example we
will study different kinds of auctions including Google's Sponsored
Search Auction, Generalized Second Price auctions, and the Stable Matching Algorithm used to pair hospitals and
medical student residents.
 2) When you don't have the luxury of designing the
rules of a game from scratch, how do you understand the
outcome of a game in the wild? We will study the equilibriums of games
and see that in many interesting models, for example traffic or
computer networks,  equilbria are
near-optimal under relatively weak assumptions.
